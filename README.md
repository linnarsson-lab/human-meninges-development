# human-meninges-development
Supplementary code and data to our study of the developing human meninges by Vinsland et al. (manuscript in preparation).

## Preprint (bioRxiv)

## Browser

Visualizations of the complete dataset, as well as cell specific subsets, are browsable at [CELLxGENE](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/7d66d871-091f-4602-9f42-85f86d2853e0).

## Data availability

### Raw sequence reads

BAM files are available from the European Genome/Phenome Archive (https://ega-archive.org/) under accession number TBA. 

### Expression matrices

- Complete count matrices (gene x cell counts) for the developing meninges and meningiomas are available as loom files [here](loom_files.md).
- The datasets can also be downloaded as .h5ad files from the browser: [CELLxGENE](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/7d66d871-091f-4602-9f42-85f86d2853e0). 

### Xenium spatial data

- Xenium data and images have been deposited at the [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/) under accession number S-BIAD1600.
- Complete count matrices (gene x cell counts) for meningiomas are available as loom files [here](loom_files.md).

## Code used for analysis and visualisation

- Clustering was performed using cytograph. Installation and usage are described [here]([url](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/adult-human-brain/tree/main/cytograph)).
